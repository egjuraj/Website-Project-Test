This project includes two carousels with distinct navigation methods. The first carousel can be controlled using "Next" and "Previous" buttons, while the second carousel supports smooth navigation through mouse scrolling. An interactive photo upload feature enhances the first carousel, allowing users to add images directly from their computer. To change a photo, users can click on a specific photo in the first carousel that they want to replace and upload a new image, providing a customizable and user-friendly experience.
